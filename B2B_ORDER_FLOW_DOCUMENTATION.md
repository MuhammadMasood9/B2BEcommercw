# B2B Order Flow System Documentation

## Overview
I've implemented a complete B2B order management system with proper negotiation flow from inquiry to order completion. The system follows the standard B2B marketplace pattern where:
- **Buyer (User)** sends inquiries for products
- **Admin (Supplier)** responds with quotations
- **Negotiation** can occur with multiple rounds
- **Buyer accepts** quotation to create an order
- **Admin manages** the order through to delivery

---

## Complete Order Flow

### 1. Inquiry Stage
**Buyer Side (BuyerInquiries.tsx)**
- Buyer sends inquiry for a product
- Status: `pending`
- Inquiry includes: quantity, target price, requirements, message

### 2. Quotation Stage
**Admin Side (AdminInquiries.tsx)**
- Admin views incoming inquiries
- Admin sends quotation with:
  - Price per unit
  - MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity)
  - Lead time
  - Payment terms
  - Valid until date
  - Message
- Inquiry status changes to: `replied`

### 3. Negotiation Stage (Optional)
**Buyer Side:**
- If buyer wants better terms, clicks "Negotiate" button
- Sends negotiation request with revised price/quantity
- Status changes to: `negotiating`

**Admin Side:**
- Admin views negotiation requests
- Sends revised quotation
- Multiple rounds possible until agreement

### 4. Acceptance/Rejection Stage
**Buyer Side (BuyerInquiries.tsx)**
- Buyer has 3 options for each quotation:
  1. **Accept** - Opens dialog to provide shipping address, creates order
  2. **Reject** - Quotation marked as rejected with optional reason
  3. **Negotiate** - Request price revision

**When Accepted:**
- Quotation status → `accepted`
- Inquiry status → `closed`
- Order automatically created with:
  - Order number (auto-generated)
  - Buyer details
  - Product details
  - Quotation terms
  - Shipping address
  - Status: `pending`

### 5. Order Management
**Buyer Side (MyOrders.tsx)**
- View all orders with filters by status
- See order journey timeline: Inquiry → Quotation → Order → Delivery
- Track order status: pending → confirmed → processing → shipped → delivered
- View tracking number when shipped
- Download invoice
- Contact supplier

**Admin Side (AdminOrders.tsx)**
- View all orders from all buyers
- Update order status
- Add tracking number
- Add notes
- View related inquiry and quotation

## RFQ (Request for Quotation) System

The RFQ system is a complementary system to the product-based inquiry system. It allows buyers to post general requirements without being tied to specific products.

### RFQ Flow

   - All their posted RFQs
   - Quotation count per RFQ
   - Filter by status
   - View quotations button

5. **Buyer Views RFQ Details** (`/rfq/:id` - `RFQDetail.tsx`)
   - Complete RFQ details
   - All quotations received
   - Accept/Reject quotation buttons
   - Shipping address dialog

6. **Quotation Acceptance**
   - Quotation status → `accepted`
   - RFQ status → `closed`
   - Buyer provides shipping address
   - Admin will create order

7. **Quotation Rejection**
   - Quotation status → `rejected`
   - Optional rejection reason
   - RFQ remains `open`
