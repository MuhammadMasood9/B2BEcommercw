# B2B Marketplace Website Prompt (Alibaba-Style) for Cursor IDE

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive B2B (Business-to-Business) marketplace platform similar to Alibaba.com. This platform connects suppliers/manufacturers with business buyers for bulk wholesale orders. The focus is on trade, wholesale pricing, MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity), and RFQ (Request for Quotation) features.

## IMPORTANT: Reference Existing Template
I have an existing ecommerce website template. Please analyze the main pages, components, and structure from my template and use them as the foundation. Adapt and enhance these existing pages to fit the B2B marketplace model described below.

**Instructions for using my template:**
1. Scan through all pages in my existing template
2. Identify reusable components (headers, footers, cards, forms)
3. Maintain the existing design language and styling approach
4. Adapt the template's pages to B2B functionality
5. Keep the same folder structure where possible
6. Preserve any custom utilities or helper functions

- **UI Components**: Use template's existing components + shadcn/ui where needed

## SPECIFIC CURSOR IDE INSTRUCTIONS

```
IMPORTANT: I have an existing ecommerce website template in this project.

Step 1: ANALYZE THE EXISTING TEMPLATE
- Scan all files in the current project
- Identify the main pages (home, product listing, product detail, cart, checkout, etc.)
- Note the component structure and naming conventions
- Identify the styling approach (Tailwind classes, custom CSS, etc.)
- Find reusable components (buttons, cards, forms, modals, etc.)
- Note the folder structure and organization

Step 2: CREATE NEW B2B PROJECT
- Create a new Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- Set up the folder structure as specified above
- Copy over the design system (colors, fonts, spacing) from the template

Step 3: ADAPT EXISTING PAGES
For each page in my template, adapt it to B2B functionality:

HOME PAGE:
- Keep the template's layout and styling
- Replace B2C sections with B2B sections
- Change "Add to Cart" to "Request Quote"
- Add RFQ section
- Add supplier showcase
- Maintain the template's hero, category grid, and product sections

PRODUCT LISTING:
- Use template's grid and card layout
- Add B2B specific filters (MOQ, supplier location, verification)
- Modify product cards to show price ranges, MOQ
- Change CTAs to "Contact Supplier" and "Request Quote"

PRODUCT DETAIL:
- Keep template's image gallery and layout
- Replace single price with tiered pricing table

- Add role selection (Buyer/Supplier)
- Add company fields for B2B

HEADER/FOOTER:
- Adapt template's header with B2B navigation
- Keep styling consistency
- Add B2B specific menu items

Step 4: ADD NEW B2B PAGES
Create these new pages using the template's component style:
- RFQ pages (create, browse, detail)
- Supplier profile pages
- Buyer and Supplier dashboards
- Messaging system
- Business verification
- Trade assurance

Step 5: IMPLEMENT BACKEND
- Set up Prisma with the schema provided
- Create API routes for all features
- Implement authentication with NextAuth
- Add real-time messaging with Socket.io

Step 6: TESTING & OPTIMIZATION
- Test all forms and workflows
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Optimize images and performance
- Add loading states and error handling

MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY:
- Use the same button styles from template
- Keep the same color scheme (or adapt slightly)
- Use template's card designs for new cards
- Follow template's spacing and layout patterns
- Reuse template's form components
- Keep the same animation and transition styles

## EXAMPLE PROMPT TO PASTE IN CURSOR

```
Create a complete B2B marketplace platform similar to Alibaba.com.

CRITICAL: I have an existing ecommerce template in this project. 
First, analyze all files in my current template and identify:

   - Transform "Add to Cart" to "Request Quote" flow
   - Adapt existing layouts to B2B context
   - Keep all existing styling and component patterns

2. ADDS new B2B-specific pages:
   - RFQ system (create, browse, quotations)
   - Supplier profile pages with verification
   - Buyer and Supplier dashboards
   - Real-time messaging system
   - Business verification workflows

3. IMPLEMENTS dual authentication:

4. CREATES key B2B features:
   - MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) display
   - Tiered pricing tables
   - Inquiry forms instead of cart
   - Supplier verification badges
   - Trade assurance indicators
   - Response rate and time tracking

   - Products with B2B pricing
   - RFQs and quotations
   - Inquiries

6. DEVELOPS API routes for all functionality:
   - Product CRUD
   - RFQ management
   - Inquiry handling
   - Messaging
   - User authentication
   - Search and filters

Tech stack:
- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (match template's approach)
- Prisma + PostgreSQL
- NextAuth.js
- Socket.io for messaging
- Shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form + Zod

Design requirements:
- Professional B2B aesthetic
- Mobile-responsive

3. Product detail with inquiry form
4. Authentication (buyer/supplier)
5. RFQ system
