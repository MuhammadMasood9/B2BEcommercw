- Referential integrity maintained
- TypeScript types generated and validated

## Verification

## Next Steps
The database infrastructure is now ready for:
1. Supplier registration and authentication system
2. Admin supplier management workflows
3. Supplier store and product management
4. Commission calculation and payout processing
5. Review and rating system implementation

All requirements from the specification (1.1, 2.1, 7.1, 8.1) have been successfully implemented in the database layer.
