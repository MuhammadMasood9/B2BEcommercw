# B2B Marketplace Website Prompt (Alibaba-Style) for Cursor IDE

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive B2B (Business-to-Business) marketplace platform similar to Alibaba.com. This platform connects suppliers/manufacturers with business buyers for bulk wholesale orders. The focus is on trade, wholesale pricing, MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity), and RFQ (Request for Quotation) features.

## IMPORTANT: Reference Existing Template
I have an existing ecommerce website template. Please analyze the main pages, components, and structure from my template and use them as the foundation. Adapt and enhance these existing pages to fit the B2B marketplace model described below.

**Instructions for using my template:**
1. Scan through all pages in my existing template
2. Identify reusable components (headers, footers, cards, forms)
3. Maintain the existing design language and styling approach
4. Adapt the template's pages to B2B functionality
5. Keep the same folder structure where possible
6. Preserve any custom utilities or helper functions

- **UI Components**: Use template's existing components + shadcn/ui where needed

## SPECIFIC CURSOR IDE INSTRUCTIONS

```
IMPORTANT: I have an existing ecommerce website template in this project.

Step 1: ANALYZE THE EXISTING TEMPLATE
- Scan all files in the current project
- Identify the main pages (home, product listing, product detail, cart, checkout, etc.)
- Note the component structure and naming conventions
- Identify the styling approach (Tailwind classes, custom CSS, etc.)
- Find reusable components (buttons, cards, forms, modals, etc.)
- Note the folder structure and organization

Step 2: CREATE NEW B2B PROJECT
- Create a new Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- Set up the folder structure as specified above
- Copy over the design system (colors, fonts, spacing) from the template

Step 3: ADAPT EXISTING PAGES
For each page in my template, adapt it to B2B functionality:

HOME PAGE:

Create these new pages using the template's component style:
- RFQ pages (create, browse, detail)
- Supplier profile pages
- Buyer and Supplier dashboards
- Messaging system
- Business verification
- Trade assurance

Step 5: IMPLEMENT BACKEND
- Set up Prisma with the schema provided
- Create API routes for all features
- Implement authentication with NextAuth
- Add real-time messaging with Socket.io

Step 6: TESTING & OPTIMIZATION
- Test all forms and workflows
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Optimize images and performance
- Add loading states and error handling

MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY:
- Use the same button styles from template
