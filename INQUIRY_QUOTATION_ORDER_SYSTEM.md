# Complete Inquiry, Quotation & Order Management System

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive B2B inquiry, quotation, and order management system for both admin and buyer sides with full negotiation capabilities, proper status management, filtering, and responsive design.

## System Flow

```
BUYER → Inquiry → ADMIN Review → Quotation → NEGOTIATION → Order → FULFILLMENT
```

### Detailed Flow:
1. **Buyer sends inquiry** from product detail page or cart
2. **Admin reviews inquiry** - can hold, reject, or accept
3. **Admin sends quotation** to buyer
4. **Buyer reviews quotation** - can accept, reject, or negotiate
5. **Negotiation phase** - back and forth counter-offers
6. **Quotation accepted** - order is created
7. **Order management** - both parties track order status
8. **Order fulfillment** - admin updates shipping, tracking, delivery status
