# ✅ User Data Filtering - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

Buyers now see ONLY their own inquiries and quotations (received from admin), not everyone's data.

---

## 🔒 Security & Data Filtering Implemented

### **1. Backend API - User-Specific Data**

#### `/api/inquiries` - Enhanced
```typescript
// Before: Showed all inquiries
// After: Filters by logged-in buyer's ID

if (currentUserId && currentUserRole === 'buyer') {
  filters.buyerId = currentUserId; // Only show THIS buyer's inquiries
}
```

#### `/api/buyer/quotations` - New Endpoint
```typescript
// Fetches all quotations
// Filters: ONLY quotations for THIS buyer's inquiries

quotations = quotations.filter((q: any) => q.buyerId === buyerId);
```

**Result:** Buyers can ONLY see:
- ✅ Their own inquiries
- ✅ Quotations received for their inquiries
- ✅ NO access to other buyers' data

---

## 📊 Complete Dynamic Data Flow

### **Step 1: Buyer Sends Inquiry**
```
Buyer (logged in) → Sends inquiry for Product X
Database stores: buyerId = current_user_id
```

### **Step 2: Admin Sends Quotation**
```
Admin → Views inquiry from Buyer A
Admin → Sends quotation
Database stores: quotation linked to inquiry (which has buyerId)
```

### **Step 3: Buyer Views Quotations**
```
Buyer A (logged in) → Opens BuyerQuotations page
Backend → Fetches quotations WHERE buyerId = Buyer A's ID
Buyer A sees → ONLY quotations for their inquiries
```
