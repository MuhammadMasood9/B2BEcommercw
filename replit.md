## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool

**Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

**UI Component System**: 
- Shadcn/ui components (Radix UI primitives) for accessible, customizable UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens
- Design system based on "New York" style variant
- Custom color palette with primary brand color (vibrant orange-red HSL: 251 89% 48%)

**State Management**: 
- React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state management
- React hooks for local component state
- Custom query client with credential-based authentication

**Form Handling**:
- React Hook Form for form state management
- Hookform resolvers for validation
- Zod for schema validation (integrated with Drizzle)

**Key Design Patterns**:
- Component composition with reusable UI primitives
- Page-level components in `/pages` directory
- Shared components in `/components` directory
- Professional B2B design language (trust signals, verification badges, information hierarchy)

### Backend Architecture

**Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework

**Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules

**API Structure**:
- RESTful API endpoints (prefix: `/api`)
- Routes defined in `server/routes.ts`
- Middleware for request logging and error handling
- Session-based authentication ready (connect-pg-simple for session store)

**Data Layer**:
- Storage abstraction pattern via IStorage interface
- Current implementation: In-memory storage (MemStorage class)
- Designed for easy migration to database-backed storage
- CRUD operations for users and business entities

**Development Setup**:
- Vite development server with HMR
- Custom middleware mode for SSR capability
- Runtime error overlay for debugging
- Replit-specific dev tooling integration

### Database Schema

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect

**Current Schema** (shared/schema.ts):
- `users` table with UUID primary keys, username, and password fields
- `products` table with comprehensive ecommerce fields:
  - Product identification: SKU, GTIN, external ID, slug
  - Descriptions: name, short description, full description
  - Pricing: regular price, sale price, tax configuration
  - Inventory: stock management, backorders, low stock alerts
  - Media: multiple images (array), tags (array)
  - Physical properties: weight, dimensions (length, width, height)
  - Visibility and publishing controls
- `categories` table with name, slug, description, icon, and parent relationship
- `customers` table with company info, contact details, and verification status
- `suppliers` table with business details, verification, and ratings
- `orders` table with customer relationships, status tracking, and totals
- Schema validation through Drizzle-Zod integration for all entities

**Migration Strategy**:
- Drizzle Kit for schema migrations (output: `./migrations` directory)
- Push-based deployment via `db:push` script
- Database URL configuration via environment variables
- Current implementation uses in-memory storage (MemStorage) for rapid development
- Storage interface designed for seamless migration to PostgreSQL when ready

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Pattern**:
- Dual-role system: Buyer and Supplier accounts
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)
- Credential-based requests throughout frontend

**Authorization Considerations**:
- Role-based access control for buyer vs. supplier features
- Verification status affecting supplier visibility
- Trade assurance and business verification workflows
