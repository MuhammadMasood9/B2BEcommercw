# Multivendor Supplier System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive multivendor supplier system for the B2B marketplace platform. The system will transform the current admin-only product management into a true multivendor marketplace where independent suppliers can register, manage their own stores, list products, and conduct business with buyers directly while the platform manages commissions and provides oversight.

## Glossary

- **Supplier**: Independent vendor/seller who registers to sell products on the platform

- **Membership_Tier**: Subscription-based access levels for suppliers (Free, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
- **Split_Order**: Order containing products from multiple suppliers, processed separately
