# Multi-Vendor Order System Implementation

## Task 6.1: Extend order system for multi-vendor support

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. Modified existing order creation to include supplier_id
- Extended the existing `/api/orders` endpoint to handle multi-vendor orders
- Added supplier attribution to single-vendor orders
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing order system

#### 2. Implemented split order functionality for multi-vendor purchases
- **handleMultiVendorOrder()** function that:
  - Groups cart items by supplier
  - Creates a parent order for tracking
  - Creates separate child orders for each supplier
  - Handles admin-managed products (legacy support)
  - Calculates commission per supplier based on membership tier

#### 3. Added supplier-specific order management endpoints
- `GET /api/suppliers/:supplierId/orders` - Get orders for a specific supplier
- `PATCH /api/suppliers/:supplierId/orders/:orderId/status` - Update order status
- `GET /api/suppliers/:supplierId/orders/:orderId` - Get detailed order information
- All endpoints include proper authentication and authorization checks

#### 4. Created order notification system for suppliers
- **notifySupplierNewOrder()** function sends notifications when new orders are received
- Notifications are stored in the database and can be displayed in supplier dashboard
- Includes order number and basic details

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### Database Schema Extensions
- Orders table already includes `supplierId`, `parentOrderId`, `commissionRate`, `commissionAmount`, `supplierAmount` fields
- Commission settings table for managing platform revenue
- Notification system for supplier alerts

#### Helper Functions Added
- `getCommissionSettings()` - Retrieves commission configuration from database
- `getCommissionRateByTier()` - Calculates commission based on supplier membership tier
- `notifySupplierNewOrder()` - Sends notifications to suppliers
- `handleMultiVendorOrder()` - Main function for processing multi-vendor orders

#### Storage Layer Extensions
- `getSupplierOrders()` - Fetch orders for specific supplier with filtering
- `getSplitOrders()` - Get child orders for a parent order
- `updateSupplierOrder()` - Update order with supplier authorization
- `getSupplierOrderStats()` - Dashboard statistics for suppliers

### 🎨 Frontend Components Created

#### OrderManagement.tsx
- Complete supplier order management interface
- Order listing with search and filtering
- Status update functionality with tracking numbers
- Detailed order view with buyer information
- Commission and financial details display

#### MultiVendorCart.tsx
- Shopping cart that groups items by supplier
- Visual indication of multi-vendor orders
- Automatic order splitting during checkout
- Clear breakdown of costs per supplier

### 📊 Order Flow Process

1. **Single Vendor Order**:
   - Customer adds items from one supplier to cart
   - Creates single order with supplier attribution
   - Commission calculated based on supplier tier

2. **Multi-Vendor Order**:
   - Customer adds items from multiple suppliers
   - System creates parent order for tracking
   - Automatically splits into separate orders per supplier
   - Each supplier receives notification
   - Commission calculated individually per supplier

3. **Order Management**:
   - Suppliers can view their orders through dedicated interface
   - Update order status (pending → confirmed → processing → shipped → delivered)
   - Add tracking numbers and notes
   - Buyers receive notifications on status changes

### 🔐 Security & Authorization

- Suppliers can only access their own orders
- Admin users have full access to all orders
- Proper authentication middleware on all endpoints
- Order ownership verification before updates

### 💰 Commission System

- Configurable commission rates by membership tier:
  - Free: 5.0%
  - Silver: 3.0%
  - Gold: 2.0%
  - Platinum: 1.5%
- Custom commission rates per supplier
- Automatic calculation during order creation
- Clear breakdown in supplier dashboard

### 🚀 Next Steps

The multi-vendor order system is now functional and ready for testing. Key areas for future enhancement:

1. **Payment Processing**: Integrate with payment gateways for split payments
2. **Shipping Integration**: Connect with shipping providers for tracking
3. **Dispute Resolution**: Add system for handling order disputes
4. **Analytics**: Enhanced reporting and analytics for suppliers
5. **Mobile App**: Extend functionality to mobile applications

### 🧪 Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Create supplier accounts and products
2. Add products from multiple suppliers to cart
3. Use the MultiVendorCart component to place orders
4. Check supplier dashboard for order notifications
5. Test order status updates through OrderManagement component

The system maintains full backward compatibility while adding comprehensive multi-vendor capabilities.
